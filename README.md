# Email Word Checker
The Email Word Checker is a tool designed to help you ensure that your emails are written without spammy or bad words that could potentially harm your business reputation. At the moment, the tool is only available in Spanish.

To use the Email Word Checker, simply copy and paste the text of your email into the tool. The tool will then check the text for any spammy or bad words that could potentially harm your business. If any such words are found, the tool will highlight them, allowing you to easily identify and remove them.

In the future, we plan to add AI technology to the Email Word Checker. This will allow the tool to automatically check the text for spammy or bad words, without the need for hard-coding a list of words to check for. This will make the tool even more efficient and effective, and will help to ensure that your emails are always written in a professional and appropriate manner.

Thank you for using the Email Word Checker. If you have any feedback or suggestions for how we can improve the tool, please don't hesitate to let me know.
